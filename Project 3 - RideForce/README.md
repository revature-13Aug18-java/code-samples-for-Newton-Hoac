## Rideforce

   [User Service](https://github.com/nhoac001/rideforce-user-service)

  This folder contains the code snippets for Project 3 - Rideforce from the User Microservice. The Project as a whole utilizes Angular for its frontend, Spring for its backend, and Jenkins for its development pipeline. 
  
  The User Microservice handles all endpoints relating to user data such as registration, login, and profile editing. It implements JWT token generation to validate users and secures endpoints based on user roles.
  During our sprint, we focused on testing, documentation, and logging. On top of that, we also implemented 4 new features:
* Password Requirements
* Batch start time
* Account active state
* Edit profile
