## Music-Based Social Network

   This folder contains code snippets for Project 2 - MBSN. As a team, we built this application using Angular for the frontend, Spring MVC for the backend, and Spotify's API for music data. 
   HttpClient facilitated communication between frontend and backend. JSON responses from the backend were processed on the frontend to display information for users. Users can login or create an account through the homepage and add/remove songs by editing their profile. Song selections are processed to generate a list of preferred music genres for each user.
