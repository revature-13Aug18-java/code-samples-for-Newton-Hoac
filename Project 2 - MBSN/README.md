    built using Angular for the frontend, Spring Data for the backend, and Spotify's API for music information. HttpClient facilitated communication between frontend and backend. JSON responses from the backend were processed on the frontend to display information for users. Users can login or create an account through the homepage and add/remove songs by editing their profile. Songs selections were processed to generate a list of preferred music genres for each user.
